My team coded a program using C++ called "SmartFridge". The motivation behind "SmartFridge" is that as college students, you face a common problem where you have limited time, limited budget, and when you open the fridge, there's not much you can work with.

Our team tried to solve mainly the last issue by creating a program that will output the most optimal recipes the user could create based off what they inputted as ingredients they have on hand. We loaded in a recipe database and created a calculating mechanism that would try to rank and categorize which recipes would match up best for the user.

This aims at reducing food waste as well as optimising the average user's daily life.

Next Steps:
Creating this in iOS and/or Android form
Adding graphics and more UI
Ability to save recipes
Ability to share creations on social media
Adding more recipes to the database
Optimising our recipe database parsing algorithm
Optimising our user input reading mechanism (upper-case, multiple word ingredients, plural vs. singular)
Creating error cases when the user enters a typo, or we were unable to match
Improving the scoring mechanism
